        <p>
          This project, undertaken by Shamil and Ashfaq, is part of their efforts to successfully 
          complete the EE6254 DevOps module. We aim to apply DevOps 
          principles, streamline development processes, and enhance system automation. Our work 
          is to integrating continuous integration and continuous deployment 
          (CI/CD) practices, ensuring efficiency, reliability, and scalability in software development. 
          This project serves as a practical learning experience, helping them gain hands-on expertise 
          in DevOps methodologies essential for modern software engineering.
